# About Me

I’m currently pursuing an **M.S. in Statistics** at UCLA, where my research focuses on spatial statistics. In particular, I am interested in regional clustering methods and geostatistical interpolation techniques for modeling spatial dependence and improving spatial prediction in real-world systems.

My coursework includes:
- Probability Theory
- Statistical Inference
- Linear Models
- Machine Learning
- Computational Statistics
