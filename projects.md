# Selected Projects

## Estimating Food Delivery Times with Statistical Learning using Python  
**November 2023 - January 2024**
- Used food delivery data from the Indian subcontinent to build predictive models with scikit-learn and XGBoost.  
- Wrangled data with the `polars` package and visualized figures using `seaborn` and `matplotlib`.  
- Achieved an average prediction error less than one-third of the standard deviation for delivery times.  

## Predicting Customer Churn with Machine Learning in Python  
**February 2023 - April 2023**
- Extracted datasets from an anonymous telecommunications firm and tidied data using `polars`.  
- Forecasted customer churn using scikit-learn and XGBoost.  
- Calculated business value of approximately $1.2 million annually per 10,000 customers.
